# Deep_Learning_Project
Melanoma detection
In the following Deep Learning project we have used a dataset composed by 2646 images of 3 types of skin lesions, respectively 
Melanoma, Nevus and Seborrheic keratosis. The 3 classes are unbalanced, where the 19% of the images are melanoma, the 67% nevus 
and the 14% seborrheic keratosis. We have decided to create a deep learning algorithm able to detect the different types of skin
lesions, with a particular attention for melanoma. 
In the first part we have applied 4 deep learning models, 2 from scratch and 2 pre-trained models (ResNet50 and MobileNetV2) to 
the unbalanced classes. In the second part we have applied the same models  with the balanced classes and in the third part we
have applied data augmentation. 
In the last part of the project we have choosen the model with the best perfromance with the use of accuracy and recall and
after  that we have applied model evaluation with Lime and Grad Cam in order to better understand where our model misclassified.
